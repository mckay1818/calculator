# Calculator

This calculator was created as part of [The Odin Project's Foundations Curriculum] (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator). I originally created the calculator when learning about the foundations of Objects in JavaScript. When later learning the principles of object oriented programming, I returned to the project and refactored it using class syntax.
The skills I focused on developing for this project were:
  - **Algorithmic Problem Solving:** I've sketched out algorithms on paper for previous projects, but I jumped straight into coding the calculator's functionality without writing out what the control flow would look like first. Never again! I wound up with an error-riddled, buggy mess until I gave up, sketched out the algorithm, and rewrote the JS from scratch.
  - **Object Oriented Programming:** This was my first project that organized JS using object oriented code, specifically using the ES6 class syntax.
